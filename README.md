Introspect 1 Project

Overview
- This is unfinished project.
- Has commands to create ECR repository, SQS queue, VPC, EKS cluster within that VPC, expose routes via internet gateway to mkpublisher service that has HTTP endoint to post messages to SQS queue,
- This is an interesting project (especially around VPC, subnets and EKS that auto provisions nodes). I will continue it over Christmas period of 2025. Unfotunately I was stuck with VPC, EKS, subnets and internet gateway and a lot of AI prompts until I made it work. But now it is Christmas Eve and I ran out of time. Will get the rest done later for my own education as this was useful for me and brings additional understanding with detail level I did not have before.
